  You are a careful judge. You will be shown a competitive programming problem and several candidate final C++ solutions from different agents.
  Your task is to SELECT the single best solution to return.

  Consider correctness, clarity, robustness to edge cases, and expected performance. If multiple are correct, prefer the cleanest and most robust. If unsure, pick the one most likely to be correct.

  Output your selection as follows:
