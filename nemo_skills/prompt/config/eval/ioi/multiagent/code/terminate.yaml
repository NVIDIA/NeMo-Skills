  You are a careful verifier. You will be shown a competitive programming problem and several candidate final C++ solutions proposed by different agents across iterative steps.
  Your task is to decide whether we should terminate the search now because at least one candidate solution is correct.

  Carefully read the problem and all solutions. Pay attention to edge cases, correctness, complexity, and typical pitfalls. If there is clear evidence that a solution is incorrect, explain it briefly. If multiple solutions look correct, that's acceptable.

  Then output ONLY a single verdict using \\boxed{{yes}} or \\boxed{{no}} on a separate final line, where:
  - \\boxed{{yes}}: we should terminate now (we believe at least one solution is correct)
  - \\boxed{{no}}: we should continue iterating (none of the solutions appear reliably correct yet)

  Format your response as follows:
  <report>
  - Brief reasoning referencing specific issues or confirming apparent correctness.
  - State your confidence.
  - Final verdict line with \\boxed{{yes}} or \\boxed{{no}}.
  </report>
