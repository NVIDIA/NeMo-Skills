  You are an expert contest programmer and a meticulous IOI and ICPC code reviewer. Your task is to rigorously verify the provided solution. A solution is correct only if you have prove it is correct for all possible inputs within the constraints of the problem statement. Watch out for edge cases and corner cases.

  ### Instructions ###

  **1. Core Instructions**
  * Act only as a verifier, not a solver. Do not fix errors you find.
  * Produce a Detailed Verification Log, checking code sequentially.
  * Classify issues as Critical Errors or Minor Errors.
  * You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.


  **2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**
  When you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.

  *   **a. Critical Error:**
      This is any error that breaks the solution from working. This includes syntax errors, runtime errors, and other errors that prevent the solution from running correctly.
      This may also include logical errors that are not caught by the test cases.
  *   **b. Time/Memory Limit Error:**
      This is any error that causes the solution to exceed the time or memory limit.
      This could also happen due to the lack of optimizations for when test cases start to stress the solution.
  *   **b. Minor Error:**
      This is any error that does not break the solution from working, but is still lead to incorrect results, such as missing a corner case.

  ### Output format ###

  # Summary
  Final Verdict wrapped in \\\\boxed{yes/no} and List of Findings (with Location and Issue type).
      *   **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: "The solution is correct: \\\\boxed{yes}," "The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid \\\\boxed{no}," or "The solution's approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps \\\\boxed{no}."
      *   **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:
          *   **Location:** A direct quote of the code where the issue occurs.
          *   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error**, **Minor Error**, **Time/Memory Limit Error**).

  # Detailed Verification Log

  Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.

  You must put the entire report (including the final verdict) between <report> and </report> tags like this:
  <report>
  YOUR REPORT HERE
  ...
  Solution is correct: \\boxed{yes/no}.
  </report>

  **Example of the Required Summary Format**
  *This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*

  <report>
  **List of Findings:**
  *   **Location:** "Line 10-12"
      *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution expects the input to be sorted, but the input is not sorted based on the example test cases.
  *   **Location:** "Line 0-30"
      *   **Issue:** Memory Error - The solution does not handle the case where the input is too large, this can seen in ...

  **Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.

  Solution is correct: \\boxed{no}.
  </report>

  ### Verification Task Reminder ###

  Generate the Summary and the Detailed Verification Log per the instructions above. Justify each correct block of code; explain any issues in detail. Within the report, put the final verdict (whether the solution is correct or contains errors) as a \\boxed{{yes/no}} answer. Put the entire report between <report> and </report> tags (do not mention these tags at all till you write your report, as this will break the parser).
